**Document ID:** EDF-000
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Approved

# 1. Purpose

The Enterprise Documentation Framework (EDF) defines the overall architecture and governance model for documentation within this repository.

Its purpose is to establish a consistent and scalable documentation framework that supports the creation, maintenance, and continuous improvement of enterprise operational documentation.

The framework serves as the foundation for all documentation standards, templates, and runbooks contained in this project.

---

# 2. Scope

This framework applies to all documentation published within the **Enterprise Runbooks** repository.

It defines the relationship between documentation components but does not specify implementation details. These details are described in the corresponding Enterprise Documentation Standards (EDS).

---

# 3. Documentation Architecture

The documentation is organized into four logical layers.

## Layer 1 – Framework

Defines the overall documentation architecture and governance model.

**Example**

* EDF-000 – Enterprise Documentation Framework

---

## Layer 2 – Standards

Defines mandatory documentation standards and conventions.

Examples include:

* Enterprise Runbook Standard
* Document Lifecycle
* Versioning Standard
* Naming Convention
* Writing Guidelines
* Quality Standard
* ITIL Mapping

---

## Layer 3 – Templates

Provides standardized templates based on the defined standards.

Examples include:

* Runbook Template
* Change Template
* Incident Template
* Maintenance Template

Templates ensure consistency across all operational documentation.

---

## Layer 4 – Operational Documentation

Contains the actual operational procedures used by administrators and operations teams.

Examples include:

* Infrastructure Runbooks
* Storage Runbooks
* Kubernetes Runbooks
* Backup Procedures
* Disaster Recovery Procedures

---

# 4. Documentation Hierarchy

The documentation hierarchy follows a top-down approach.

```text
Enterprise Documentation Framework (EDF)
            │
            ▼
Enterprise Documentation Standards (EDS)
            │
            ▼
Templates (TMP)
            │
            ▼
Operational Runbooks (RB)
```

Each layer depends on the layer above it.

Changes to higher-level documents should be evaluated for their impact on lower-level documentation.

---

# 5. Guiding Principles

The framework is based on the following principles.

* Standardization
* Consistency
* Simplicity
* Reusability
* Maintainability
* Traceability
* Continuous Improvement
* Vendor Neutrality

These principles guide the development of all documentation within this repository.

---

# 6. Repository Organization

Documentation is organized by purpose rather than by technology.

The repository separates:

* Framework documents
* Documentation standards
* Templates
* Operational runbooks
* Supporting resources

This separation improves maintainability and enables independent evolution of each documentation layer.

---

# 7. Governance

The Enterprise Documentation Framework is the highest-level document within this repository.

All Enterprise Documentation Standards (EDS), templates, and operational runbooks shall align with the principles defined in this framework.

Changes to the framework should be made carefully, as they may affect the overall documentation architecture.

---

# 8. Continuous Improvement

The framework is intended to evolve over time.

Feedback from contributors, operational experience, infrastructure changes, and industry best practices should be considered when reviewing future versions.

Major changes to the framework should be reflected in a new document version and communicated through the project's version history.

---

This framework is supported by the following documents:

* EDS-001 – Enterprise Runbook Standard

* EDS-003 – Versioning Standard
