# 1. Purpose

The Quality Standard defines the minimum quality requirements for documentation within the Enterprise Runbooks repository.

Its objective is to ensure that all documentation is accurate, complete, consistent, maintainable, and suitable for operational use.

---

# 2. Scope

This standard applies to all controlled documentation, including:

* Framework documents (EDF)
* Documentation standards (EDS)
* Templates (TMP)
* Runbooks (RB)
* Supporting documentation

---

# 3. Quality Principles

Every document should meet the following principles.

### Accuracy

Information shall be technically correct and reflect the current operational process.

---

### Completeness

All mandatory sections and required information shall be present.

No essential operational steps should be omitted.

---

### Consistency

Terminology, formatting, and document structure shall remain consistent throughout the repository.

---

### Clarity

Documentation shall be easy to understand and free from ambiguity.

Instructions should allow different operators to achieve the same result.

---

### Maintainability

Documents should be easy to update as technologies and operational procedures evolve.

---

### Traceability

Changes shall be documented through document versioning and Git history.

---

### Reusability

Documentation should remain as vendor-neutral and environment-independent as practical.

---

# 4. Operational Quality Requirements

Operational documentation should:

* Define a clear objective.
* Describe prerequisites.
* Include step-by-step procedures.
* Identify operational risks.
* Define validation criteria.
* Include rollback procedures where applicable.
* Reference related documentation when appropriate.

---

# 5. Documentation Review

Before approval, every document should undergo a quality review.

The review should verify:

* Technical accuracy
* Compliance with applicable standards
* Editorial consistency
* Completeness
* Readability

---
